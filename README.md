# Classroom-Racer
A fun and interactive classroom racing game where teachers can add classrooms and pupils, and start a race. Each pupil is represented in the racing arena, and the teacher can click on each pupil's racer to make them jump to the next level. The game continues even after a pupil reaches the final level, allowing the rest of the pupils to continue playing.
